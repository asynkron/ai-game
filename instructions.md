# AI Instructions

* Always try to reuse existing functionality, donÂ´t create new formulas for existing functionality.
* When refactoring, make sure to update all calls to the refactored function.
* Use constants where possible, do not hardcode values.
* Never change unrelated code, only change the code that is necessary to complete the task.
* when moving functions/code from one file to another, do it verbatim, do not change the implementation or inputs / outputs or anything, stay as close to the original while keeping everything working.
